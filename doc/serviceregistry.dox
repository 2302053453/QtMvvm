@class QtMvvm::ServiceRegistry

This is the class responsible for the dependency injection (DI) part. All services registered
with the registry are available for DI. When using lazy initialization, services themselves
can also have dependencies to be injected. When the registry creates them it will
automatically inject them. Automatic DI is also done for ViewModel created by the CoreApp.

@note If a service has a slot named `qtmvvm_init()` it is called automatically by the registry
right after all dependant services have been injected.

The following example shows how to use DI. The first shows how to use it with a simple,
interface-less service for an already created object:

@code{.cpp}
// service.h
class Service : public QObject
{
	Q_OBJECT

public:
	Q_INVOKABLE explicit Service(QObject *parent = nullptr); //required signature

public Q_SLOTS:
	void baum();
	void qtmvvm_init(); //is called by the registry
};

// myclass.h
class MyClass : public QObject
{
	Q_OBJECT

	QTMVVM_INJECT_PROP(Service*, service, _service)

	//...
private:
	Service *_service;
};

//main.cpp
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	QApplication a(argc, argv);
	QtMvvm::ServiceRegistry::instance()->registerObject<Service>();

	//...

	auto myObj = new MyClass(parent);
	QtMvvm::ServiceRegistry::instance()->injectServices(myObj);
	// _service is now initialized via a valid Service
}
@endcode

The second example shows how to use it for interface based services and on objects that are
created via the registry:

@code{.cpp}
// iservice.h
class IService
{
public:
	virtual inline ~IService() = default;

public Q_SLOTS:
	virtual void baum() = 0;
};

#define IServiceIid "com.example.myapp.IService"
Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(IService, IServiceIid)

// service.h
class Service : public QObject, public IService
{
	Q_OBJECT
	Q_INTERFACES(IService)

public:
	Q_INVOKABLE explicit Service(QObject *parent = nullptr); //required signature

public Q_SLOTS:
	void baum() override;
	void qtmvvm_init(); //is called by the registry
};

// myclass.h
class MyClass : public QObject
{
	Q_OBJECT

	QTMVVM_INJECT_PROP(IService*, service, _service)

public:
	Q_INVOKABLE MyClass(QObject *parent = nullptr); //required signature

	//...
private:
	IService *_service;
};

//main.cpp
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	QApplication a(argc, argv);
	QtMvvm::registerInterfaceConverter<IService>();
	QtMvvm::ServiceRegistry::instance()->registerInterface<IService, Service>();

	//...

	auto myObj = QtMvvm::ServiceRegistry::instance()->constructInjected<MyClass>();
	// _service is now initialized via a valid IService
}
@endcode
